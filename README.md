# glixl

Glixl is a super-basic 2D sprite/tile engine, very heavily influenced by the fantastic
[jaws.js](https://github.com/ippa/jaws), but using webgl rather than 2d-canvas.

Currently includes basic support for:
* Sprites
* Sprite sheets
* Basic animations
* Tile maps 
* Scrolling viewport
* Tile map collision
* Keyboard controls
* Mouse controls
* Simple lighting

Still to do:

* Touch input
* Animated tiles
* Make lighting blend better

Glixl has enough functionality at this stage to make simple games.
